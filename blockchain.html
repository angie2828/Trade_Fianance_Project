        <p dir="auto">According to the World Trade Organization nearly 80-90% of world trade is faciliated by Trade
            Finance, which involves financial institutions providing short-term finance in the form of letters of credit
            or guarantees to facilitate the the exchange of goods and services. Trade finance originated thousands of
            years ago in Mesopotamia, the oldest examples of trade finance instruments, such as promissory notes and
            letters of credits, can be found in Babylonian clay tablets dated around 3000 BC.</p>
        <p dir="auto">According to the analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, the global trade flows are estimated to
            hit a record US $24 Trillion by 2026, and the trade finance revenues projected at US $48 Billion in the next
            three years, with a growth rate exceeding at 6% a year. rage</p>

                </svg></a>Implementing our Smart Contracts for Trade Finance</h2>
        <p dir="auto">The increased transparency behind blockchain makes the trade finance process faster and if
            designed correctly, blockchain technology can reduce the motivation for misconduct. Using a public
            blockchain such as Ethereum for trade finance transactions is problematic in terms of privacy issues, since
            everyone can participate without proof of identity and everyone is able to track a wallet's transaction
            history, including the correspondent input data. Given this, we encryted some of our inputs using the
            one-way hash function.
            For our smart contracts, we suppose that the owner knows the roles and the corresponding public addresses of
            each participant. In addition, we assume the financing party comply with the anti-money laundering (AML)
            guidance for blockchain, which requires entities to know their opposite parties when trading with each
            other. Any transaction with an anonymous party are forbidden.</p>
        <p dir="auto">In addition the AML requirements, we implement a whitelist contract which admits wallet addresses
            that want to finance a deal in our second smart contract. We assume a know your client (KYC) check has been
            completed beforehand and the identities behind the wallet addreses are known by the buyer. All other
            involved parties do not need to know the identities, since the rules implemented in the smart contract
            manage the addresses. By setting the minimum requirements, a balance that is clearly higher than the
            required funding amount for the trading deal, one is able to control who can join the whitelist.
            Additionally, the applicant must exceed a specific score, which is similar to an investment score. Only
            financiers who fulfill the conditions of a sufficent wallet balance and score will be approved.</p>

            can help all the three parties involved i.e. buyers, sellers and banks to conduct trade transactions in a
            frictionless and timely manner.</h1>
        <p dir="auto">Banks in particular can overcome the trade finance lifecycle and operational challenges faced by
            imbibing digitial restructing into their trade finance operations such as Artificial Intelligence,
            Blockchain, Internet of Things and Machine Learning.</p>
        <p dir="auto">According to the Boston Consulting Group, an integrated digital solution having functions like
            intelligent automation, collaborative digitization and other advanced technology solutions would help global
            trade banks save US $2.5-$6Billon with the potential to increse revenue by 20%-35% over 3 to 5 years.</p>
        <p dir="auto">Banks can deliver a frictionless trade finance experience by - Eliminating the need for manual
            paperwork, Speed up trade processes, Enhance collaboration with trading counterparties, Automated Workflows,
            Centralized Trade Finance Operations, Seamless Experience across Multiple Channels, Provide delivery
            assurance to buyers through trade asset tokenization.</p>
        <p dir="auto">Three key features of Blockchain are instrumental in treating the major pain points of trade
            finance:
            The Cryptographic security underlying blockchain technology enables information immutability and
            credibility, the distributed ledger architecture provides transaction transparency and traceability, the
            network consensus mechanism provides a single source of truth for enabling native issuance of financial
            assets (trade receivables and other payment obligations can be natively issued in blockchain to reduce fraud
            and enable banks to offer more attractive financing.</p>
